The shares are significantly lower among those who have lived in their community six to 10 years (54%) or less than six years (44%). Some people say that people are less involved with their communities than 20 years ago. It is difficult to measure community involvement, but there are several factors that may contribute to this perception. For example, the rise of technology and social media has changed the way people interact and communicate with each other. People may spend more time online and less time participating in local community activities. Additionally, changes in work and family dynamics may also play a role. With longer working hours and increased demands on personal time, people may have less time and energy to devote to community involvement. However, it is important to note that community involvement can take many forms, and people may still be engaged in their communities in different ways. Some people may volunteer their time or donate to local charities, while others may participate in online communities or advocate for causes they care about. Overall, community involvement is a complex issue, and it is difficult to make generalizations about trends over time."]);

One of these trends is the sustained changes to funder behavior, which could lead to new types of charities emerging. Additionally, technology is constantly evolving, and it is possible that new charities will emerge to address issues related to technology 2.However, it is difficult to predict exactly what types of charities will emerge in the future.
